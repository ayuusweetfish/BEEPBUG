# BeepBug

*ðŸš§ Final touches are work-in-progress, ETA spring 2024*

*BeepBug* is an interactive art installation, the thematic idea being that harmony between the artificial and the natural environment will supplant opposition.

The work comprises two sound-emitting cubes (or what could be perceived as shrubs), which aim to draw the audienceâ€™s attention to the delicate interconnections between naturality and artificiality. This central idea is manifested in intertextual relationships formed simultaneously in the auditory, the visual, and the cognitive domain.
